Machine learning algorithm written in Python
- Requires basic linear algebra
- Uses Numpy for matrix operation to avoid costly looping in Python
- Usually includes notebook for easy visual
- Simple examples provided

to run each algorithm, `cd` to corresponding directory and run (replace `***` with the corresponding name):

```
python ***.py
```
