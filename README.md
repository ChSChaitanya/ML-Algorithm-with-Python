## ML Algorithm with Python

Machine learning algorithm written in Python
- Requires basic linear algebra
- Uses Numpy for matrix operation to avoid costly looping in Python
- Usually includes notebook for easy visual
- Simple examples provided

to run each algorithm, `cd` to corresponding directory and run the following (replace `***` with the corresponding algorithm) in terminal:

```
python ***.py
```

### 1. Linear regression

#### cost function

#### gradient descent

#### feature normalization


### 2. Logistic regression
